## 👋 Hi, I'm Raffael

I'm a software developer with a passion for building scalable web applications. I enjoy diving into complex problems and crafting elegant, maintainable code—whether it's backend architecture or full-stack development.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me on two wheels exploring new roads, or scribbling verses that blend rhythm and reflection. I believe good software, like good poetry, should be both functional and beautiful.

### 💻 Tech I work with
- Laravel, Node.js, and modern JavaScript frameworks
- React Native, Expo.Dev frameworks

### 🏍️ Outside the terminal
- Motorcycle enthusiast — speed, solitude, and scenery
- Poetry lover — words that move, silence that speaks

### 📫 Let's connect
Feel free to reach out or explore my projects. I'm always open to collaboration, learning, and meaningful conversations.
